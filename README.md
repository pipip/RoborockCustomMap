# Roborock Custom Map

This allows you to use the core Roborock integration with the [Xiaomi Map Card](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card)

### Setup

1. Install the [Roborock Core Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=roborock) and set it up
2. It is recommended that you first disable the Image entities within the core integration. Open each image entity, hit the gear icon, then trigger the toggle by enabled.
3. Install this integration
4. This integration works by piggybacking off of the Core integration, so the Core integration will do all the data updating to help prevent rate-limits. But that means that the core integration must be setup and loaded first. If you run into any issues, make sure the Roborock integration is loaded first, and then reload this one.
5. Setup the map card like normal! An example configuration would look like
```yaml
type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
vacuum_platform: roborock
entity: vacuum.s7
map_source:
  camera: image.s7_downstairs_full_custom
calibration_source:
  camera: true
```
6. You can hit Generate Room Configs to allow for cleaning of rooms. It might generate extra keys, so check the yaml and make sure there are no extra 'predefined_sections'
